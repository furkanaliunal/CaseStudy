# This yaml file is responsible for messages
# Messages have specific arguments like player, target, server name, location and more.
# But unfortunately, you can use only the arguments that are already in the message by default.
# They are called using "{x}"
# You can change the locations of arguments or remove them.
# You can also remove a message to disable message send on event
